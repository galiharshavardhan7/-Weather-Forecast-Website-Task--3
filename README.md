**Description**

**Weather Forecast Web Application Project**

Overview

This project aims to create a web application that provides the current day's weather forecast and a 5-day forecast for a given location. The application will utilize an API to fetch real-time weather data and will also include a feature to automatically detect the user's location.

**Technical Requirements**
Frontend: ReactJS
Backend: Node.js
Programming Language: JavaScript
API: OpenWeatherMap API (or similar)

**Features**

User Input: Allow users to input their location (city, state, country) to retrieve the weather forecast.

Automatic Location Detection: Implement a feature to automatically detect the user's location using geolocation APIs.

Current Day's Weather Forecast: Display the current day's weather forecast, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
5-Day Weather Forecast: Display a 5-day weather forecast, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for each day.

Real-time Data: Use an API to fetch real-time weather data and update the application accordingly.

**API Integration**

Use the OpenWeatherMap API (or similar) to fetch real-time weather data.
Integrate the API with the Node.js backend to retrieve and process weather data.

**Frontend Implementation**
Use ReactJS to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
Design a user-friendly interface to display the weather forecast data.
Backend Implementation
Use Node.js to create a RESTful API to handle user requests and interact with the weather API.
Implement API endpoints to retrieve and process weather data.
Example Use Cases
A user inputs their location (e.g., "New York, USA") and the application displays the current day's weather forecast and a 5-day forecast.
A user enables automatic location detection, and the application displays the weather forecast for their current location.
Deliverables
A fully functional web application with a user-friendly interface.
A RESTful API to handle user requests and interact with the weather API.
A detailed report on the implementation, including code snippets and explanations.

**Timeline**

Week 1-2: Research and planning
Week 3-4: Frontend implementation (ReactJS)
Week 5-6: Backend implementation (Node.js) and API integration
Week 7-8: Testing and debugging
Week 9: Finalize and deploy the application
